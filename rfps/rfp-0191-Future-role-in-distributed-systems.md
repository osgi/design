# Application Domain

## Applications are becoming...
- **Distributed:** From an architecture point of view
	- System is always in flux and partial failure
- **Multilingual:** From a development point of view
	- System designed as protocols, data formats, communication patterns.
	- Not as language APIs
- **Containerized:** From an operations point of view
	- Generic, but restricted interface: posix

## How it works
- **Leverage containers**
	- They allow multilingual apps
	- They allow resource control
- **To move as much function as possible...**
	- Away from the application code
	- Into "Orchestrators"
		- Shield the app form the "fallacies of distributed computing"
	- Ultimately we get to FaaS
- **Orchestrator enforces particular...**
	- Shape of the app: what it can do
	- Assumptions about what it needs
- **CaaS (K8S, Swarm):**
	- Apps
		- Stateful
		- Long running
		- Weak at handling changes in environment
	- Orchestrator 
		- Tries to make the environment look as static as possible
		- Tries to keep at least one instance running
- **FaaS (OpenWhisk, Fn):**
	- Apps
		- Stateless
		- Short running
		- Unaware of environment
	- Orchestrator
		- Wraps application code into an executor container
			- E.g. a container with `node.js`
		- Container exposes a strictly defined call interface to Orchestrator
			- E.g. `/init` to inject the application code and `/call` to make a function call.

## Problem Description
- **Problem: Where does OSGi fit?**
- **OSGi app shape:**
	- App code in simple bundles: annotation driven 
		- Especially since OSGi R7: DS, Bundle annotations, ...
	- Managing infrastructure on board: `RSA` + `DS` + `ConfigAdmin` + ...
		- Rather than in the Orchestrator
- **OSGi app traits:**
	- Can be deployed on a wide array of operational infrastructure: `os` -> `vm` -> `container`
	- Module layer provides: building low footprint apps (for a Java app)
	- Service layer provides: adaptive apps (killer feature?)
	- Merge/Split depending on scaling needs:
		- E.g. run my components on the same JVM for dev and in container-per-subsystem in prod.
		- E.g. redistribute components between JVMs to improve performance/locality.
- **Solution: approach**
	- Find OSGI's natural place in today's distributed systems as a peer to the other technologies
	- **Do not try to match feature-for-feature...**
		- Other Java platforms: Spring(Boot), Microprofile
		- Other languages: node.js, Go
	- **Try to find the problems OSGi solves in a unique way**
		- If someone solves them better - then see if competition make sense.

# Requirements

- An open discussion on OSGi's future yielded the lines of inquiry described below.
- These are not final, we hope to get as much additional suggestions, questions and corrections as possible.

## CaaS, FaaS deployment:
- **Not strictly "distribution", but relevant**

- **Pressure on Java to...**
	- Reduce footprint: disk, (more important) memory 
	- Reduce startup time

- **JVM solutions**
	- JPMS: reduces JRE, but not clear if it helps in general (some day `jlink` produces faster images?)
	- Substrate VM: reduces everything at a high cost
	- Java frameworks and libraries have to adapt first (especially to Substrate VM)

### OSGi now
- Reduce footprint with the requirement/capability based component assembly.

### OSGi future
- Adapt to JPMS
	- [RFP-190: Resource encoding for Java Modules](https://github.com/osgi/design/blob/master/rfps/rfp-0190-Resource%20encoding%20for%20Java%20Modules.odt)
	- [RFP-143: OSGi connect: remove modular layer](https://osgi.org/svn/documents/trunk/rfps/rfp-0143-OSGiConnect.pdf)
		- Diverges into a different topic: what to do if Java moves to JPMS and abandons OSGi.
		- Must make sure these still work: extender pattern, whiteboard pattern, requirement/capability/wiring/resource runtime model
- Adapt to Substrate VM
	- *New RFP:* Make sure the OSGi core can compile: remove modular layer? (Is there already an RFP for this? If not, can we open one?)
- Push for light weight components
	- **Conjecture:** Go, node.js, etc. are efficient because they don't have the Java heavyweight libraries.
	- Programming model: (lambda/async over)? DS over CDI
	- Communication:
		- ? over JAX-RS
		- Do not use REST within a distributed cluster
	- Persistence:
		- ?
		- Persistent Actors
	- Tracing
		- ?
	- ... what else?

## CaaS communication model
- CaaS (K8S, Swarm) tend to use a "brute force" approach to shield the application 
	- Cluster every distributed component
	- Play with network to keep every component accessible through a static name
	
### OSGi now
- RSA enables a app to handle the true distributed environment dynamics
- Client-Side loadbalancing: 
	- RSA publishes as local services **all** suitable remote endpoints
	- App can load balance
- Circuit-breaker: 
	- When all remote endpoints go down DS stops local consumer component until an endpoint comes back up
- Errors handling:
	- Rather than just stop or retry app can see event and take alternative action
- Distributed lifecycle/Continuous recovery:
	- RSA publishes local services that represent the lifecycle of remote resources
	- App can tie it's lifecycle to the remote resources
	- For example:
		1. Database is published as a service of arbitrary type, but with a property for the DB URL
		2. A component will start when a service with a DB URL property it can use appears
		3. A component will stop when the DB goes away and restart/recover when it comes back
	- *NOTE:*  Seems to enable actor-like behavior where components can reset to initial state when remote calls fail
- **Question:** Can/Should the app react to changes to global system state?
	- E.g. start processing requests when the entire system is ready?
		- Rather than just the immediately visible remote endpoints
	- E.g. user publishes remote endpoints as global signals?
- *NOTE:* Tie ourselves to "reactive" as in "reactive manifesto" 
	- But it's more about async message passing, than our type of "reactive"
	
### OSGi future
- Adapt RSA to CaaS
	- How does OSGi communicate to CaaS it should scale it up/down?
		- CaaS monitors cpu/memory and potentially custom metrics
			[K8S horizontal pod autoscale](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-metrics-APIs)
		- Enhance RSA to collect metrics and push to CaaS?
	- How does an OSGi instance load balance between all possible candidates it can call?
		- Talk to CaaS to get performance data?
		- RSA distributes the Cluster Information Service to everyone?
	- How does OSGi integrate with services that do not use RSA?
		- RSA talks to CaaS to get instance information?
		- RSA talks to CaaS to get endpoint information?
	- *Impl or RFP:* Load Balancing Topology Manager
		- *NOTE:* Compare with what others are doing: Eureka, Envoy, ...
		- The distribution provider only distributes
		- Load balancing decisions should be made by the topology manager: controls the service hook.
		- Specify at least a name other than `promiscuous` for the topology manager
		- Every subset of remote endpoints may have different loadbalancing needs
		- ...
	- [RFC-240: Compute Management Service](https://github.com/osgi/design/blob/master/rfcs/rfc0240/rfc-0240-Compute-Management-Service.pdf)
		- Prototype is about top-down calls from OSGi to CaaS to create/destroy containers etc.
			- I.e. OSGi is part of the *control plane*
		- Extend with bottom-up API for OSGi to CaaS to pull/push performance/discovery data.
			- I.e. OSGi participates in the *data plane*
- Adapt to "brute force" approach (without RSA?)
	- Explore if/how this reduces the value of the service layer
		- E.g. service dynamics do not matter: containers are static, remote endpoints too.
		- E.g. but service dynamics still free you from doing the start/stop order of modules manually
		- E.g. but service layer is still a good abstraction to hook modules together
- Integrate with modern distributed ecosystem
	- **Question:** Should we target the CNCF ecosystem as something of near-standard stability?
	- *Impl:* Not clear if there is anything to specify
		- These are moving targets rather than long-lived standards, we may specify SPIs to plug them into RSA...
	- RSA adoption of https://opentracing.io/
	- RSA discovery for Consul, Eureka, .. K8S API server?
		- **Question:** Is it worth doing this or just give up since sidecar loadbalancing (e.g. Envoy) seems to take over?
			- Sidecar load balancing does not propagate cluster topology changes back to app - no distributed lifecycle.
		- [Ribbon](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/announcing-ribbon-tying-the-netflix-mid-tier-services-together-a89346910a62)
	- RSA distribution providers for gRPC, thrift, etc.
	- RSA/PuthStreams distribution providers for AMQP, MQTT, etc.
	- RSA topology manager with...? K8S API server?

## Application distribution
- **Conjecture**: The world demands agile horizontal scalability more than vertical scalability (in-process efficiency)
	- Some: expand at unlimited scale (not everyone is google)
	- Most: keep it small, but expand and shrink rapidly

### OSGi now
- Decouples the decision to distribute from the decision to reuse logic
	- Makes it cheaper to re-distribute code when tuning the distribution layout.
	- [Monoliths, Cookie-Cutter or Microservices?](https://paulhammant.com/2014/12/07/moniliths-cookiecutters-or-microservices/)
	- [Microservices, bounded context, cohesion. What do they have in common?](https://hackernoon.com/microservices-bounded-context-cohesion-what-do-they-have-in-common-1107b70342b3)
	- [Design Patterns for Microservices -> Decomposition patterns](https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-for-microservices?edition=408215&utm_source=Weekly%20Digest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Weekly%20Digest%202018-10-24)
- Using containers as the *universal* unit of modularity/reuse is wrong
	- Gluing components via the limited container interface incurs heavy performance penalties
	- Distribution is also a fundamental architectural change
		- Failure handling changes fundamentally
		- Opens new attack surfaces to secure
- It is (very) hard to decide on a distribution layout

### OSGi future
- Automate the distribution decisions.
- Discover cut lines using the requirements/capability model
	- E.g. at the remotable services
- Apply OSGi Resolver to distribute bundles between runtimes.
- *NOTE:* Related to [RFP-188: Features](https://github.com/osgi/design/blob/master/rfps/rfp-0188-Features.pdf)

## Asynchronous programming
- **Conjecture**: 
	- Not used in enterprise, because container Orchestrators promise to solve it through brute force scaling.
	- Used in IoT where the operator has no control over the network.

- **Helps to express concurrency:**
	- Improve quality: 
		- Responsiveness/liveness
			- E.g. a thread that handles an incoming request will not block waiting for a downstream response.
		- Remain available even in the face of partial failures 
			- E.g. at external integration points - db, peer process, etc.
			- [GOTO 2016 • Stability Patterns & Antipatterns • Michael T. Nygard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZePNGQojfA)
	- Improve performance: 
		- Run more on less CPU/Memory
	- Improve diagnostics: 
		- Async infrastructure enables access to the fine grained tasks
	- **Question:** Do OSGi services provide benefits to the async programming model?
		- No: Promises and PushStreams are libraries
		- Yes: AsyncService together with RSA

### OSGi now
- AsyncService, Promises, PushStreams
	
### OSGi future
- *New RFC:* General purpose messaging service (probably based on PushStreams)
- *New RFC:* Actors

# Appendix

## Hystrix
Hystrix is a library that adds certain measure of resilience to distributed applications where the prevailing 
communication mechanism is point-to-point synchronous calls (e.g. HTTP requests).

At present it is succeeded by [ressilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j), which is inspired
by it's design and offers the same core patterns.

Here we explore the design of Hystrix to find analogies with the current OSGi specifications and pinpoint potential
improvements to OSGi for R8.

[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works)
[Hystrix Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Netflix/Hystrix/images/hystrix-command-flow-chart.png)

- **Question**: What is it for?
	- Distributed application resilience to calls to remote dependencies
	- It is purely a client-side library
	- Tuned for the Netflix use case:
		- E.g. each node has a large number of remote dependency nodes to load balance
	- *NOTE:* Our conditions are probably different
		- Not a humongous scale
		- But saturation of a limited compute pool that may change rapidly
			- E.g. add/remove new nodes to CaaS to handle spikes in load
			- E.g. CaaS shuffles containers aggressively around the current nodes to saturate them better
		- **Question:** Does Hystrix help there?
		
- **Question**: How does Hystrix relate to the other Netflix projects (Ribbon, Eureka, Archieus)?
	- It only implements the circuit breaking behavior
	- It uses Ribbon for client side load balancing
	- Ribbon uses Eureka for discovery
	- Ribbon/Hystrix use Archius for configuration.
	- ...
	
### Design assumption: Most network access is performed synchronously
- **Question**: Do all the patterns built around this work for other communication patterns?
	- Event driven?
	- Note that event driven may be built on top of sync calls to queues for example.

### Design assumption: Failure and latency can occur in the client-side code as well, not just in the network call
- Client side degradation is managed through a local thread pool that can reject incoming calls once full: *shedding load*
- Server side failures are managed through *circuit breaker*, *health tracking*, *timeouts*. 
- Server side degradation is managed indirectly through *shedding load* too.
	- It doesn't matter if a remote call is slow to respond or the local client is overloaded.

### Design implementation: convert sync remote calls to async
- Built around making async "command" wrappers on top of arbitrary sync call
- It is assumed that within the "command" block the user makes a remote call via an arbitrary client library. E.,g.: http, grpc, soap
- *NOTE:* Similar to the `AsyncService` wrapping an RSA endpoint
- *NOTE:* This can be used to gain resilience in other parts of the system. E.g. local disk access. 

### Design implementation: programming model
- Each "command" provides an `rx.Observlable` back to the caller
- `rx.Observable`: [HystrinxCommand.observe()](http://netflix.github.io/Hystrix/javadoc/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixCommand.html#observe--)
	- *NOTE:* Similar to a `PushStream`
- `java.util.concurrent.Future`: [HystrixCommand.queue()](http://netflix.github.io/Hystrix/javadoc/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixCommand.html#queue--)
	- In reality backed by the `rx.Observable`
	- *NOTE:* Similar to a `Promise`. Can convert back to sync, via `Promise.getValue()`
- **Question:** When does a command return multiple results to the `rx.Observable`?
	- It seems the user can design a command that either emits one value or many

### Design implementation: hook alternative behavior
- User overrides methods on `HystrixCommand`
- `HystrixCommand.getFallback()`: returns one value immediately
	- *NOTE:* Similar to `Promise.fallbackTo(Promise fallback)`
- `HystrixCommand.resumeWithFallback()`: returns an `rx.Observable` which emits one or more values.
	- *NOTE:* Similar to `Promise.recoverWith(Function<Promise, Promise> recovery)`
- *NOTE:* Uniquely OSGi can also hook lifecycle changes as a fallback behavior
	- E.g. RSA detects all endpoints are unhealthy or missing: take down service rather than `circuit breaker`

### Design implementation: discovery
- Ribbon has pluggable discovery
- *NOTE:* RSA has pluggable discovery too: e.g. call K8S master for the pods, rather than zookeeper
	
### Design implementation: load balancing
- Hidden inside the Hystrix impl is Ribbon that does the load balancing, maybe health monitoring, etc.
- *NOTE:* OSGi invisible to app: RSA can do internal load balancing behind one service endpoint
- *NOTE:* OSGi visible to app: RSA can provide all endpoints and app can create a load balancing wrapper
	- Similarly to how `AsyncService` is applied to an existing service.
	- Maybe even an extension to `AsyncService`
	- Maybe extensions to RSA to decorate endpoints with metrics so the extended `AsyncService` can make decisions.

### Design implementation: threading
- Each command has it's own thread pool
- If thread pool is exhausted "load shedding" is applied: commands are failed immediately.
- *NOTE:* Similar to a `PushStream` impl or a `Promise` impl with it's own executor
- **Question:** A command is a one-shot thing while the thread pool must remain. How are they hooked?

### Design implementation: status/monitoring
- `HystrixCommand` is stuffed with informative methods
	- E.g. why a certain result happened: circuit breaking, load shedding, timeout, local cache hit, called through to remote side
	- E.g. log of the circuit breaker
- *NOTE:* The best OSGi has is `Promise.isDone()`, `Promise.getFailure()` (with special exceptions?)
- *NOTE:* It is not clear how much of that API is for the application and how much for other tools.
